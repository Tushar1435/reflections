When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Answer:When I need to share my project with other teammates or view their commits I would use remote
repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually 
rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If you are working on some change and don't want git to merge those changes before we finished it 
is hepful in that case.
